I hereby present GMK Perestroika (Перестройка) to you.

The rich dark red colour is a standout feature of this set. Its Cyrillic alphas give the set a unique aesthetic and are a nod to its name, Perestroika, which points to connotations of reformation and openness. In the same way, I hope its users will be empowered to be more daring - to unleash new ways of thinking and working when using the set.
